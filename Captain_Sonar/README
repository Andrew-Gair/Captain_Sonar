This is a work in progress program.

Directory structure:
"Resources" contains the different maps the game can be played on.
"Source" contains the code used in program compilation/execution.

How to run program:
A makefile is included. After removing old main.x file (with 'rm main.x'), typing "make" will compile the program.
Run the program with './main.x'.

You will be prompted throughout the program for user-input.
There is a barebones type-check to limit entry failures (for example, entering a string when prompted for an integer).

Most features are functional, one notable absence is 'Sonar' functionality. A core feature awaiting implementation.
